# Overview and File Descriptions

This project contains several source files, each implementing a specific functionality. Below is a brief explanation of each file and its purpose:

### palindrome.c

Contains a function that receives a string and checks if it is a palindrome.
It ignores spaces, tabs, and is case-insensitive. The function returns `1` if the string is a palindrome and `0` otherwise.

### count_zero_bits.c

Includes a function that takes an unsigned integer and counts how many bits in its binary representation are zero.
The function returns this count.

### magic.c

This program handles an `N x N` matrix of integers, where `N` is set using a `#define`.
It reads the matrix elements from input, prints the matrix in a clear two-dimensional format, and then reports whether the matrix is a basic magic square or not.
